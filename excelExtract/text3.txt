Appeal Rights
The payment above is based on the terms of your benefit plan. On request, the internal rule, guideline, protocol, criterion or standard used 
in making this decision will be provided to you free of charge. If an adverse decision was based on medical necessity, experimental 
treatment or similar exclusion, an explanation of how the decision was made will also be provided free of charge upon request. You or your 
authorized representative may appeal this determination by following a 2-level appeal procedure. To file a Level 1 Appeal, send a written 
request within 180 days of this notice to 15422 Detroit Road, Lakewood, OH 44107. The appeal will be reviewed and determined by
someone other than the individual who made the original benefit determination. You will be notified of the Level 1 Appeal decision within 15 
days (pre-service claim) or 30 days (post-service claim) of the date the Plan received the appeal. If the Level 1 appeal is denied, you may file 
a Level 2 Appeal within 60 days of the date of the Level 1 decision. Appeal procedures for Level 1 apply to Level 2 Appeals. If the Level 2 
Appeal is denied, you may elect voluntary arbitration or bring civil action under Section 502 (a) of ERISA if your plan is covered by ERISA. For 
further information, please consult your summary plan description.
